<pre>Accidents will happen,
but then they grow up
and someone is blamed
for them.

In fact yes, mom did
drop me on my head in
a roundabout way, but
that is not
what is
wrong
with
me.

I am deeply embarrassed
by my own success,
by my own privilege,
by my own whiteness,
by my own unmetered rage,
and by my own hands —
the awful results they've
wrought.

I am an impostor...
was I made this way?

Accidents will happen.
In fact yes, some grow up
to have accidents
of their own
and accidentally fall off
into coldest voids
due to accidents of the
unknown.

Searching with those broken
hands and feverish brains
for something to call
their own.
they fight frothing currents
deep into the unknown.
until an accident
delivers them
home.

Until an accident
delivers them
home.

Waves fiercely crash upon
faces unknown and
bodies unknown and
laughter unknown and
waves fiercely push upon
heartstrings and bone —
until accidents happen.

Torn asvnder,
cast across,
rewinding summers —
suddenly born alone.

Until an accident
rides in the waves,
crashes and delivers them

Home.</pre>

<pre>Every once in a fly's lifespan,
he steps back out on that ledge again
and makes a damned mess in a fragment
of the space-time continuum.

He flattens smiles like fresh asphalt,
and smoothes away the happiness—
Why can't he just be positive?
All the time!
Every time!
Never Negative!
Always full of SUNSHINE...

Gets stuck on one progression,
that one break in a song that loops over
and over...
and over...
pushing everything over.
Haunting the bones with Dorian modes
and restless diatonic dreams bring
buckets of sweat brimming with regret
and over
and over
(so over).

He snuck a climb back up there again,
indeed a pretty view can be had
and the sun's fingers feel not so bad.
Until the break recedes and the last
drum beat pierces the warming rays.

Snared!
On that ledge not scared, oh why can't
he be happiness
and ponies
and rainbows
and stop the smothering...

SNARED!

Pressed into her void there,
as though anyone might ever dare
to get back on that ledge again.</pre>

<pre>Tell me what I am supposed to do
after putting all of my eggs into
a basket shaped like you.

My yellow heart now scrambled
into bits — sadness with fits,
square jawed death knells and
rust blunted wits.

This is my brain on drugs.

Yes, I have numerous questions —
regarding high temperatures and
melting points.

I am burnt toast; there will be
no butter,
no jam —
except between rocks and hard
places.

I have lost most my teeth and I
reek of burned grease.

BREAKFAST

it's what's for dinner.

Welcomed when it came with any
type of smile, though we both
know
that
breakfast
can only last for a while.</pre>

<pre>For Anjuli


Cold but not alone for hours on
the telephone and these are some
things she might have said to me:

You look around sometimes
You are not at the end of
    Anyone's rope.
You are not wrapped around
    Anyone's finger.
You are not embedded in
    Anyone's heart.

Your selectable hopping campfires
Are casting them all in shadow and
You sometimes turn around to catch
Yourself in the shadow too.

You exist to amuse them?
Are you yourself amused?

You told me one time
about the little you.

You tried the Kava yet?

[a long and wondrous pause]

Are you still with me?

You seem to be with everyone.

Are you still on the line?

You told me it was cold tonight.

You made me say something tonight.
You somehow made me say that thing.
and you know it wasn't my habit—

Yet, I said it to you.

Anyway—

A message from the future:
You will not ever hear me say it again.

Are you with me?
You are probably tired and cold.
You have become one with the circuits.
You lost focus.
You lost me.

Anyway—

My Amsterdam boots, remember those?

A message from the future:
You foolishly affixed yourself
to the bottom of their soles.

You make me laugh so much
and that is why I said it.

You make me want to be with you.

Are you still with me?

Yeah — oh yeah, that's right...

You're almost with me
    and
yet not.</pre>

this awful junk

I want to put this stuff away

    to take a breath
      that sets me free

<pre>yes — my worst ran ragged
        it leapt and swept
        sadness over seawalls

yes — my worst tore shit up
        and reached your shores
        all too much

no good part of my soul
no good sound from my mouth
no good touch from my fingers

        found your coast
        to be clear
        nor a beach to hold near

        or heart to beat same
        or warmth in whispers of
        your name

no good time alone
no good starry skies
no good journeys of mind

        landed upon your
        sunny mountainside
        like welcome raindrops

        or lovingly lodged
        in your heart metaphor right
        through the concrete blast door

yes — we thought we'd found
        the tide, the moon, the stars when
        wind plus water blended into waves

yes — the break rode like a roller coaster
        mad undertow and riptides that stole
        away everything we used to know

yes.

i am

no.

good for you</pre>
